# Zendaya
Online Fashion Store webapp for AF Module SLIIT 2020 

## Requirements
  * Develop a Web application for Online Shopping Cart System for a Fashion Store. System functionality will be as follows:
      1. There are three roles as admin, store manager, and user.
      2. Anyone can view products as a guest (without login).
      3. Only users who logged in to the system can place orders.
      4. Once the admin creates a login for the store manager, it should be notified to the
      store manager via email.
      5. Admin can create categories for the products.
      6. The store manager can,
      Add products with details to the relevant category
      Add discounts to selected products.
      7. User can add products to the shopping cart.
      8. Users can purchase the selected products in the shopping cart by selecting the
      payment method (card/cash on delivery, etc.).
      9. Users can create a wish list from their preferred products and later they can add
      those products to the shopping cart.
      10. Users can rate the products and add comments and average ratings, comments
      should be displayed for products.
      11. The system should be secured and cannot be accessed without a proper
      authentication.
      12. Authorization should be maintained, and users cannot order products without
      going through payment methods. (No need of integrating to a payment gateway,
      but until the step of payment the system should be implemented).
